# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis utilized supervised machine learning algorithms to train, evaluate and make predictions based on patterns present in the data. The purpose was to analyze a data set on credit card credit from the LendingClub.Due to the unbalanced classes expected with credit risk classification the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn librarys were implimented to evaluate models through resampling. For the predictions both oversampling, using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, and undersampling, using ClusterCentroids, were performed along with a combination of over and under sampling through SMOTEENN algorithm.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
